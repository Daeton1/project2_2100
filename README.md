write up: This project uses Python to analyze corporate sales data and visualize trends such as best-selling products, customer purchasing behaviors, and store performance. By leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizations, insights were generated to highlight key metrics like frequently purchased items, total sales per store, and the prevalence of large-basket transactions (orders with more than three items). The dataset, stored in a CSV file, was processed to group, aggregate, and identify trends. Visualizations include bar charts for best-selling products, pie charts for sales distributions, and line graphs for monthly revenue trends. These graphs are saved as image files for reference, showcasing the potential of Python in deriving actionable business insights. To run the analysis or generate visualizations, ensure the script, dataset, and required libraries are available, and execute the script in a Python environment.
